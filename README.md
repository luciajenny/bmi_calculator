# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## My Goal

I customised Flutter Widgets to achieve a beautiful user interface designs.
If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are,
I can create them using Flutter.
Here I used containers, cards, expanded, and conditionals for animation including tenary and enums.

I created custom widgets and classes to extended stateless widget that can set state easily.
I also passed functions from other classes and implemented them as properties of another class while dedicated classes also existed.
Dribble and ColorPiker were useful in detecting the exact styling and UI from the designs.

Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator).
It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
